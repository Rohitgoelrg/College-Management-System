# "College-Management-System"
In today’s time of digital INDIA initiative there are still hundreds of schools and colleges in India, especially in rural or sub-urban parts where the work of administration of the schools/colleges is still done by ink and paper. This project is an initiative to develop a simple, yet user-friendly environment to make efficient management of the records of the college digitally. The primary aim is to reduce the manpower and paper work required to maintain data and records, also to automate the process and speed up the management.

The primary aim is to reduce the manpower and paper work required to maintain data and records, also to automate the process and speed up the management.

The current projects available might be well furnished in all the functionalities but they lack the user-friendly GUI, which enables only urban colleges to adapt these projects. This project is kept as simple as possible so that the colleges with not so updated systems and admins can also implement this project in their respective institutions.



The functionalities of this project are:

1.	 Login and Registration: This contains sign in and sign up pages for all the uses of the project.

2.	 Student Details: This module contains all the details of the Student. For e.g.: - name, roll number, guardian details, course,      address, contact no. etc.

3.	 Faculty Details: This module contains all the details of the Faculty. For e.g.: - name, faculty ID, subject, highest qualification, address, contact no, pay scale etc.

4.	 Accounts Details: This module contains the details of the fee of Student and Faculty salary.

5.	 Course Details: This module contains the details of the courses offered by the college.
